## Installation

👩‍💻SpeechStylis AI is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 with **python >= 3.9, < 3.12**.

**Tested Platforms:**
- Ubuntu
- Kali Linux
- Google Cloud


```bash
pip install TTS
```


If you are on Ubuntu (Debian) or Kali Linux, you can also run following commands for installation.

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/haydenbanz/SpeechStylis.git
```

## Modify .py File to Specify Pre-recorded Audio Location

To use your prerecorded audio, locate the `.py` file and find the section where the speaker's WAV file path is defined. Update the `speaker_wav_path` variable with the path to your audio file. Below is an example:

```python
# Original Code
speaker_wav_path = "/content/drive/MyDrive/audio.wav"
```

## run in google collab
